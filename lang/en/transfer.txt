Here you can transfer all changed pages tagged with a selected tag to the client wiki. Media files used on the tagged pages will also be synced to to the client wiki.

Select the tag to see a preview of affected files, then fill out the change summary and start the transfer. Depending on the amount of affected files, the transfer can take a while.

You can sync recent page deletions along the regular page transfer. If you choose to do that, any pages - regardless of tags! - deleted in the primary wiki since the last sync will also be deleted in the primary wiki. (This will only go as far back as the global changelog - 7 days by default - so check your Dokuwiki configuration.)
